    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi! I'm a curious and passionate developer with a love for building things from scratch. This blog website was built as part of a fun coding exercise using <strong>Node.js</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>, and <strong>EJS</strong> ‚Äî entirely from scratch!</p>
    
    <p>I come from an IT background, enjoy solving problems, and exploring the world of web technologies. Besides coding, I enjoy long walks, spicy food, and collecting interesting bugs (in code, not real life üêû).</p>
    
    <p>My goal is to continuously improve and build meaningful tools ‚Äî and share a few stories and thoughts along the way.</p>

    <p>If you're reading this, thanks for stopping by. Stick around, read a blog post, or even better ‚Äî write one!</p>
